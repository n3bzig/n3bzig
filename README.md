# Hi I'm Ben,

> A living portfolio, technical diary, and public thinking space by Ben Ziegenfusz.

## About

I’m a systems-focused generalist working at the intersection of XR, infrastructure, and AI.  
This repository isn’t a product—it's a workspace. A place to share fragments, frameworks, experiments, and reflections as I explore:

- Immersive systems in complex environments  
- Scalable architecture for XR pipelines  
- Human-computer interaction and interface design  
- Functional dev environments and automation  
- AI-assisted development and deployment without forgetting the human

Most of my work lives between disciplines, constructing the systems that allow others to build and scale.  
What you’ll find here isn’t polished product. It’s the loop I run to refine ideas, test structure, and show my thinking.

## Sections #ToDo
- ops-automation/
Tools, scripts, and infrastructure I’ve used to automate workflows across simulation deployment, dev environments, and general IT ops. This includes container setups, CI/CD pipelines, scheduled build tools, and system hardening configs. Think: repeatability, reliability, and clean handovers.

- XR-pipelines/
Modular pipelines that connect XR content creation with versioning, packaging, deployment, and update delivery. These frameworks were designed for low-overhead teams in enterprise environments, integrating Unreal Engine, Jenkins, Meta SDKs, and asset management tools.

- demos/
A collection of experimental prototypes, feature showcases, and simulation utilities. Some are one-offs, others are vertical slices. Each one reflects a key phase in my design/dev process—co-design, testing, deployment, or UI/UX trials.

## Philosophy

This space follows a few principles:

- **Plaintext first.** Keeping it simple and accessable with a roadmap to the Rich Enviroment
- **Build to understand.** Not everything here will ship: but everything has taught me something.
- **Low ceremony, high fidelity.** I prefer meaningful design over flashy delivery. Functionality in focus.

## Current Focus

Right now I’m:

- Consulting on systems architecture for SME's
- Exploring XR pipelines for WEBXR, AndroidXR and productivity outcomes.
- Building a low overhead dev environment for rapid iteratve design
- Mentoring new developers and helping orgs avoid technical debt in convergent stacks
