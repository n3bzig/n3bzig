# Hi I'm Ben,

> A living portfolio, technical diary, and public thinking space by Ben Ziegenfusz.

## About

I’m a systems focused generalist working at the intersection of XR, infrastructure, and simulation.  
This repository isn’t a project, it’s a workspace. A place to share fragments, frameworks, experiments, and reflections as I explore:

- Immersive training systems in complex environments  
- Scalable architecture for XR pipelines  
- Human Computer Interaction and interface design  
- Low-code/no-code dev environments and automation  
- AI assisted development, simulation, and deployment  

Most of my work lives between disciplines, constructing the systems that allow others to build.  
What you’ll find here isn’t polished product. It’s the loop I run to refine ideas, test structure, and show my thinking.

## Sections #ToDo

- `notes/`  
  Raw ideas, implementation logs, architectural sketches, and XR/HCI research links.

- `demos/`  
  Code snippets, interactive prototypes, simulation tools, and concept trials.

- `talks/`  
  Presentation outlines, speaking engagements, and decks on XR infrastructure, training systems, and digital twins.

- `archive/`  
  Previous projects, deprecated concepts, and system autopsies.

## Philosophy

This space follows a few principles:

- **Plaintext first.** No fluff communication, no buzzword inflation.
- **Build to understand.** Not everything here will ship: but everything has taught me something.
- **Low ceremony, high fidelity.** I prefer meaningful design over flashy delivery.

## Current Focus

Right now I’m:

- Consulting on systems architecture for SME's
- Exploring AI enhanced XR pipelines for simulation content
- Building a low overhead dev environment for Unity XR and IoT
- Mentoring new developers and helping orgs avoid technical debt in immersive stacks
